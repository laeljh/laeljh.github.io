            <p>Welcome to my part of the internet.</p>
            <p>I will do my best so that it reflects me well.</p>
            <p>So I will do my best that it doesn't need to be curated.</p>
            <p>As it curates itself.</p>
            <p>If bots can do it, let's let them.</p>
            <p>If someone else has done it great, let's use that.</p>
            <p>Adequate treatment, not equal treatmen</p>
            <p>If it's unique or special, I'll want to add it by hand.t.</p>
            <p>(Like adding a bot)</p>
            <p>But if it's not so unique...</p>
            <p>(Like adding three bots)</p>
            <p>Then maybe it's better to add a botadder.</p>
            <p>I'll do everything tedious asap.</p>
            <p>And take my time making the things I like.</p>
            <p>And I'll take my time to tweak and polish the things I like.</p>
            <p>By the end of the day it's never perfect.</p>
            <p>Growth in that many directions takes that much time.</p>
            <p>Still, pretty darn good.</p>
